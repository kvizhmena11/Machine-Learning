Per-(Store, Dept) Prophet forecaster for the Walmart submission.

WHY THIS IS NOT THE STORE-LEVEL DESIGN IT USED TO BE
----------------------------------------------------
The previous revision fit one Prophet model per STORE (45 series) and
recovered (Store, Dept) rows by scaling each store's forecast by that
department's constant historical share of the store's total. That design
cannot represent department-level seasonality at all: inside a store, every
department got the same seasonal curve, only rescaled. Departments do not
behave that way - electronics roughly triples in the pre-Christmas week
while grocery barely moves, and lawn/garden peaks in spring - so the only
department-specific time variation the model could express was a single
on/off holiday multiplier.

The Kaggle test horizon (2012-11-02 to 2013-07-26) is made almost entirely
of what that design could not represent: Thanksgiving and Christmas (which
WMAE weights 5x) plus a full spring season. It scored ~4,700 WMAE on the
leaderboard while its Aug-Oct holdout - which contains neither a holiday nor
a spring - reported ~2,900. The holdout was not measuring the failure mode.

This revision fits one Prophet model per (Store, Dept) series (~3,300 of
them), which is the entire point: seasonality and holiday coefficients are
now learned per department. It is affordable because a MAP fit on ~143
weekly points with uncertainty sampling switched off takes a fraction of a
second, and the fits are embarrassingly parallel.

Series too short for a yearly seasonality to be identifiable, and (Store,
Dept) pairs that appear in test but never in train, fall back to a
department-level national seasonal profile scaled to that series' own level
- see `FallbackStats`. Even the fallback path therefore carries department
seasonality, which the old constant-share design never did.

Prophet models are serialized with prophet.serialize.model_to_json rather
than raw pickle - that round-trips through joblib.dump and MLflow artifact
logging far more reliably than a cmdstanpy/Stan-backed object would. Dump
the pipeline with compression (joblib.dump(..., compress=3)); ~3,300 model
JSON strings are a few hundred MB raw and compress to a small fraction of
that.

Worker functions are module-level so joblib's loky backend can pickle and
dispatch them - the same reasoning src/arima_forecaster.py documents for its
own per-series worker.

No em dashes anywhere (project code-style rule) - hyphens only.

# The dataset's weeks end on a Friday and cover the 7 days [ds-6, ds]. Where
# Christmas falls inside that grid moves from year to year, so the number of
# pre-Christmas shopping days captured by the week the competition MARKS as
# the Christmas holiday is NOT constant:
#
#   week ending 2010-12-31 covers Dec 25-31 -> 0 days of the Dec 15-24 rush
#   week ending 2011-12-30 covers Dec 24-30 -> 1 day  (Dec 24)
#   week ending 2012-12-28 covers Dec 22-28 -> 3 days (Dec 22, 23, 24)
#
# Test's Christmas week is 2012-12-28. It therefore contains three times the
# pre-Christmas trade of any Christmas week a model can learn from, and a
# plain on/off holiday dummy - which is all a `holidays` dataframe can
# express - necessarily underpredicts it. WMAE weights that week 5x and it is
# the largest sales week of the year, so this is expensive.
#
# These two regressors count the relevant December days in each week
# directly. The fitted coefficient is then per-DAY rather than per-week, so it
# extrapolates to 2012 and 2013 correctly instead of assuming every Christmas
# week looks like the training ones.
#
# Note the week-51 peak weeks (2010-12-24, 2011-12-23, 2012-12-21) all

    The defaults are deliberately conservative. Each series is ~143 weekly
    points and the test horizon runs 39 weeks past the end of it, so a freely

    seasonal fit into a bad forecast. `growth="flat"` drops the trend term
    entirely (level + seasonality + holidays); `"linear"` with a small
    `changepoint_prior_scale` is the damped alternative. Both are worth
    A/B-ing on a holiday-containing fold - see the notebook.

    `seasonality_mode="additive"` is the safe default here too: many
    (Store, Dept) series have a small or occasionally negative level
    (Weekly_Sales includes returns), and multiplicative seasonality on those
    is unstable.
